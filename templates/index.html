        <p>
            Autism is a developmental disorder with symptoms that appear within the first three years of life. Its formal diagnostic name is autism spectrum disorder. The word “spectrum” indicates that autism appears in different forms with varying levels of severity. That means that each individual with autism experiences their own unique strengths, symptoms, and challenges.

Understanding more about ASD can help you better understand the individuals who are living with it.

            <h2>How autism spectrum disorders are described?</h2>
            <p>
                Psychiatrists and other clinicians rely on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to define autism and its symptoms. The DSM-5 definition recognizes two main symptom areas:

Deficits in social communication and interaction
Restricted, repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities
These symptoms appear early in a child’s development—although diagnosis may occur later. Autism is diagnosed when symptoms cause developmental challenges that are not better explained by other conditions.

The definition of autism has been refined over the years. Between 1995 and 2011, the DSM-IV grouped Asperger’s Syndrome and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) with autism. Asperger’s syndrome was an autism spectrum disorder marked by strong verbal language skills and, often, high intellectual ability. PDD-NOS was a more general diagnosis for people who did not fit clearly into the other two categories.

However, the DSM-5 no longer recognizes Asperger’s syndrome or PDD-NOS as separate diagnoses. Individuals who would previously have received either of these diagnoses may now receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder instead.

            <h2>
Autism presentations and behaviors
            </h2>
            <p>
Individuals with autism may present a range of symptoms, such as:

Reduced eye contact
Differences in body language
Lack of facial expressions
Not engaging in imaginative play
Repeating gestures or sounds
Closely focused interests
Indifference to temperature extremes
These are just a few examples of the symptoms an individual with autism may experience. Any individual could have some, all, or none of these symptoms. Keep in mind that having these symptoms does not necessarily mean a person has autism. Only a qualified medical professional can diagnose autism spectrum disorder.

Most importantly, an individual with autism is first and foremost an individual. Learning about the symptoms can help you start to understand the behaviors and challenges related to autism, but that’s not the same as getting to know the individual. Each person with autism has their own strengths, likes, dislikes, interests, challenges, and skills, just like you do.
